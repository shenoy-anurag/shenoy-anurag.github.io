## Overview
Simple Reddit is inspired from the popular forum website, [Reddit](https://reddit.com/). It is being built as class project for CEN 5035 at the University of Florida. Simple Reddit is a forum for anyone to post content and comment on posts built using Angular JS, Go, and MongoDB.

The aim of the project is to use Agile methodologies to quickly develop shippable code and to iteratively improve the product based on feedback.

We are using Github Projects to manage our Sprints, writing user stories as Issues and building functionality to close issues and achieve milestones. We are also documenting the project on the repo's wiki.
