## Overview
Inspired by [Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard), and Chess, I wanted to create my own python package for Elo ratings.

### What is Elo-Viz?

Elo python package to simulate matches between players, and compare their elo ratings after each match, and visualize them. You can use it to simulate rankings of Chess players.

Published to Python Package Index (PyPI)!
https://pypi.org/project/elo-viz/

```python
import uuid
from elo_viz import Match, Player

magnus_carlsen = Player(id=uuid.uuid4().hex, name='Magnus Carlsen', rating=2833)

m1 = Match(match_id=uuid.uuid4().hex, player1=magnus_carlsen, player2=gukesh_d)
m1.update_result(winner=magnus_carlsen.id)

print(m1.player1)
```
Output
```log
Player: Magnus Carlsen Rating: 2883.0 Win %: 100.0
```

## Installation

Install using pip:

```text
pip install elo-viz
```

or with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

```text
poetry add elo-viz
```

## Usage
### Create Players
```python
import uuid
from elo_viz import Match, Player

magnus_carlsen = Player(id=uuid.uuid4().hex, name='Magnus Carlsen', rating=2833)
hou_yifan = Player(id=uuid.uuid4().hex, name='Hou Yifan', rating=2633)
gukesh_d = Player(id=uuid.uuid4().hex, name='Gukesh Dommaraju', rating=2777)
divya_d = Player(id=uuid.uuid4().hex, name='Divya Deshmukh', rating=2490)
```

### Setup Matches
```python
m1 = Match(match_id=uuid.uuid4().hex, player1=magnus_carlsen, player2=gukesh_d)
m1.update_result(winner=magnus_carlsen.id)
```

### Check results
```python
print(m1.player1)
```
Output
```log
Player: Magnus Carlsen Rating: Rating: 2883.0 Win %: 100.0
```

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.13

The version of the base environment I had installed poetry in.

Will update this so that any Python 3 version will work.

## Future plans

The package is fully functional for basic elo rating calculations.

However, it is in the planning phase, and I plan to add many more features over time.

The plan is to allow the user to easily create simulations, and display rankings.

Eventually, I'll use Seaborn to visualize elo rating histories, rankings, and more.

## Tools used
### Poetry
https://python-poetry.org/

Package and environment management.

### GitHub Actions
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/

CI/CD to publish your package to PyPI whenever a certain event occurs.

In my case, I chose that event to be whenever I decide to create a release.
