## Overview

I faced several problems yesterday (2nd February, 2022) trying to get my keras-dev container up and running in order to contribute to keras open-source project. I would like to prevent others from ending up wasting their time trying to solve this, so that they can dive right into the interesting stuff -- contributing to keras.

## Problems I faced
The biggest issue is that `Bazel` couldn't be installed within an `aarch64` docker container.

Another issue was that `tf-nightly` couldn't be installed.

## Keras Dockerfile
The Dockerfile keras provides you has a Bazel section which looks something like this:
```dockerfile
# Install Bazel
RUN apt update
RUN apt install curl gnupg -y
RUN curl -fsSL https://bazel.build/bazel-release.pub.gpg | gpg --dearmor > bazel.gpg
RUN mv bazel.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
RUN echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://storage.googleapis.com/bazel-apt stable jdk1.8" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bazel.list
RUN apt update && apt install bazel -y
```

While this works with `amd64` (x86_64) systems, it doesn't work with `arm64` systems as the bazel package repository at <https://storage.googleapis.com/bazel-apt> doesn't have any pre-built binaries for `arm64/aarch64` systems like the M1 macbooks.

Due to this, we get an error like:
```bash
 => ERROR [9/9] RUN apt install bazel -y                                        0.5s
------
 > [9/9] RUN apt install bazel -y:
 #12 0.123
 #12 0.123 WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with 
 # caution in scripts.

 #12 0.448 Reading state information...
 #12 0.493 E: Unable to locate package bazel
------
executor failed running [/bin/sh -c apt install bazel -y]: exit code: 100
```

While looking for the solution, I stumbled upon this issue <https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13925> which gave me hints as to what I should do.

Github user [@keith](https://github.com/keith) mentioned an important point in the thread -- that bazel version 4.2.x is probably the first version to support M1 macs.

And Github user [@philwo](https://github.com/philwo) recommended to download the arm64 linux binaries and modify their permissions to allow execution.

Using these tips, I set about trying to make it work. 
However, I was still stuck and unable to get the bazel command to work.

So I have decided to share the final solution and explain each step in case a beginner wants to contribute to keras on an `arm64/aarch` system like M1 Macbooks.

The Dockerfile which solves all issues:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

# https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-advanced#_creating-a-nonroot-user
ARG USERNAME=keras-vscode
ARG USER_UID=1000
ARG USER_GID=$USER_UID

# Create the user
RUN groupadd --gid $USER_GID $USERNAME \
    && useradd --uid $USER_UID --gid $USER_GID -m $USERNAME \
    #
    # [Optional] Add sudo support. Omit if you don't need to install software after connecting.
    && apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y sudo bash \
    && echo $USERNAME ALL=\(root\) NOPASSWD:ALL > /etc/sudoers.d/$USERNAME \
    && chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/$USERNAME

# Nano (to make my life easier)
RUN sudo apt install nano -y

# Install Bazel arm64
RUN sudo apt update
RUN wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/4.2.1/bazel-4.2.1-linux-arm64
RUN sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin/bazel
RUN sudo mv  bazel-4.2.1-linux-arm64 /usr/local/bin/bazel
RUN sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bazel/bazel-4.2.1-linux-arm64
RUN export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/bazel"
RUN echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/bazel"' >> ~/.bashrc
RUN sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/bazel/bazel-4.2.1-linux-arm64 /usr/bin/bazel
RUN sudo bazel

USER $USERNAME
ENV PATH="/home/$USERNAME/.local/bin:${PATH}"
```

The `wget` line downloads the 4.2.1 version of Bazel built for arm64 systems to the present working directory (PWD).

We create the destination folder in the following line and move the downloaded Bazel binary to it.

We then allow the file to be executed by using the `chmod +x` command.

After that, we add the path to our PATH environment variable so that the OS can recognize when we type a command (`bazel`).

`RUN sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/bazel/bazel-4.2.1-linux-arm64 /usr/bin/bazel`

In this line, we create a symlink to the binary file from `/usr/bin/bazel`. This tells the OS that whenever we type `bazel` in the command line, we want it to execute the file `bazel-4.2.1-linux-arm64`.

Finally, `sudo bazel` extracts the binary.

Now, the docker container will be built successfully and you will have bazel ready to use.

I have added the above as a Gist here: <https://gist.github.com/shenoy-anurag/e501fbef1ba551b04404a3e173533aa8>

## Python Requirements
The next step according to the [Keras contributing guidelines](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/7857fa00431634ce59585e087d2d694b81669548/CONTRIBUTING.md) is to install the python requirements.

You will get another error for tf-nightly. This is because tf-nightly doesn't have any `aarch64` wheels.

Instead, install `tensorflow-aarch64` which has wheels built for aarch64, but the latest version as of today is 2.7.0. However, you'll have to make do, unless you build tensorflow from scratch from the latest git repo code.

Mike Chan has a good article on that on medium: <https://medium.com/@m7807031/how-to-install-tensorflow-in-different-os-languane-framework-66b3beaa1b3d>

We'll go with [`tensorflow-aarch64`](<https://github.com/KumaTea/tensorflow-aarch64>)

Install using:
```
pip install tensorflow-aarch64
```

or better yet, replace the line `tf-nightly` in `requirements.txt` with `tensorflow-aarch64`.

and continue with the steps on Keras's contributing guidelines page.
