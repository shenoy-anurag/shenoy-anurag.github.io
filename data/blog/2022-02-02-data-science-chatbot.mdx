I made a chatbot named Gyan (which means knowledge in Hindi/Sanskrit) which teaches you concepts of machine learning and data science.

Gyan is built using the [Rasa framework](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa).

He can do/teach the following:
- Teach you about concepts of AI, Machine Learning and Data Science
- Answering some FAQs about AI, Machine Learning and Data Science
- Direct you to my website if asked
- Handling basic chitchat
