## Overview

I was building a new project recently, and needed to create a new random secret.

I took this as an opportunity to learn about security and brush up my skills like password hashing, salts, cryptographically secure keys, randomness etc.

After my rabbit hole journey, I got back to the task at hand.

TLDR: Have a Mac? `openssl rand -hex 32`.

## Prerequisites
### OpenSSL
#### For MacOS:

```bash
brew install openssl
```

#### On Windows:

Use this if you have Git installed:

```
C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\openssl.exe
```

Else, build it yourself:
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-WINDOWS.md

#### Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install openssl
```

## Generate random secrets
### Base64
```
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Hex
```
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Try it out!

If you like rabbit holes, look up OS entropy and random generators.
